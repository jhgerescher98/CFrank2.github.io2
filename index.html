			<h1>The Phoenix Project</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In the book’s opening, Steve Masters, the excitable and persuasive 50-something CEO, promotes Bill Palmer to VP of IT Operations as Steve has just fired both of Bill’s bosses--the CIO and the VP of IT Operations. Steve explains that he himself will stand in as CIO for the time being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bill, a former Marine, liked his old job in Middleware and did not want to assume a position where the last three people to hold it only lasted for two years each before they “left the company” (were fired). Steve persuades Bill to take the role and explains that Parts Unlimited’s fate rests on the shoulders of an important IT project, project Phoenix, which is already late and over budget.</p>
<p>The board recruits a quirky IT hot shot, Erik Reid, to mentor Bill in cleaning up the IT organization. Erik uses visits to Parts Unlimited’s manufacturing facility to explain the value of Lean methods and draws parallels to IT operations.</p>
<p>Through Erik’s mentorship, Bill dives into learning “the three ways”, the “four kinds of work”, and learns why WIP is the quiet killer of both manufacturing and IT alike.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Project is relatable to people who may be new to IT because of the parallels between IT and operations based jobs. For example, in one scene symbols (think Wingdings font) have replaced social security numbers in the payroll data and in an attempt to scramble and fix the issue so that employees can get paid, the team ends of crashing some servers which only makes the problem worse. I think we have all been there.</p>
<p>All in all, the book is a pretty good read which will introduce, or bring to life, concepts that are laid out in my next blog post entitled “Theory to Practice: How to make the DevOps shift.”</p>

			<h1>What is DevOps?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better manage unplanned work.</p>

<h1>What is Texas A&amp;M University?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Texas A&amp;M University (Texas A&amp;M or A&amp;M) is a public research university founded in 1876 and located in College Station, Texas. In 1948, Texas A&amp;M University became the founding member of the Texas A&amp;M University System. As of 2017, Texas A&amp;M's student body is the largest in Texas and one of the largest in the United States. Texas A&amp;M's designation as a land, sea, and space grant institution—the only university in Texas to hold all three designations—reflects a range of research with ongoing projects funded by organizations such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. In 2001, Texas A&amp;M was inducted as a member of the Association of American Universities. The school's students, alumni—over 500,000 strong—and sports teams are known as Aggies. The Texas A&amp;M Aggies athletes compete in 18 varsity sports as a member of the Southeastern Conference.</p>
